### Fiber Optic Cables

You connect to the switch in a generic port with an adapter.
FC - Older won't see much on newer gear. You twist them on.
LC - Little connector - connects into a SFP
SC - Stick and Click 
ST - Stick and Twist
\*MT-RJ - Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack, popular with small form factor - Many Twist

### Adapters

RJ(registered jack)45 - Ethernet connector
RJ11 - Phone connector

\*GBIC - an adapter for SC fiber cables multi-mode or single mode 1 Gbps, Converts electric to optical, converts optical to electrical, modular

\*SFP (small forum pluggable) - and adapter for LC fiber cables 1 Gbps, small form factor transceiver, converts electric to optical, converts optical to electrical, modular, newer that replace GBIC

SFP+ (small forum pluggable plus) 16Gbps
QSFP (Quad small forum pluggable) 4 connectors 4 Gbps
QSFP+ (Quad small forum pluggable plus) 40 Gbps

Spanning Tree Protocol - Something with Fiber cables to link them

### Cable Management

Patch Panel - uses a punch down tool to connect wire where other end is a RJ45 to the switch
Has a different layout to punch down the wires.

66 Block - Old way to punch down connections (no longer used for data) (16Mhz)
110 Block - 100Mhz

\*The 66 block (older type/primarily used in analog telephone systems) and the 110 block (newer type/used in computer networks) are examples of punchdown blocks used for connecting sets of wires.

-    True ( Your answer)

\*Which of the following answers refers to a proprietary European alternative to 110 block?

### Ethernet

#### Copper
UTP - RJ45/RJ11/RG6 (Docsis)/Twinax (need the right SFP) - 
Used for cable television, long distance cable run, coaxial
RG59 - Coaxial Cabling, twinaxial cabling - Used for short range cable runs, Analog Video CCTV
F-Type - CONNECTOR commonly used for cable television and cable modems 
10Base2 - 10Mbps, 1 Base, 200 meters
10BaseT - 10Mbps, 1 Base, Twisted Pair (Ethernet)
100BaseTX - 100Mbps, 1 Base, Twister Pair (Fast Ethernet)
1000BaseTX - 1000Mbps, 1 Base, Twister Pair (Gig Ethernet)
10GBaseT
40GBaseT - Shieled

#### Fiber
Multimode (500m)/single mode(5000m)
100 Base
1000 Base/ 1G Base
10G Base
50G Base
100G Base
200G Base
-Fx Fiber
-Sx Short (multi mode) - SR
-LX Long (Single mode) - LR
We can leverage multiple frequency for fiber to be able to send and receive at the same time.
