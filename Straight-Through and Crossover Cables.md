## Ethernet cross-over cables
- Connect MDI to MDI
- Connect MDI-X to MDI-x
- Auto-MDI-X is on most modern Ethernet devices
	- Automatically decides to cross-over
- This is obviously not 568A on one side and 568B on the other
	- 568A and 568B are cabling standards
	- The TIA-568 standard does not define Ethernet (or other) crossover cables
